=head1 NAME

Bot::Cobalt::Plugin::Silly::FMK - Bot::Cobalt plugin for asking who the bot would F, M, or K

=head1 VERSION

version 0.001

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Because the "game" that this plugin is based on contains a somewhat offensive
word, you can change the word the bot uses to refer to it.

   ## In plugins.conf
   FMK:
      Module: Bot::Cobalt::Plugin::Silly::FMK
      Opts:
         censor: hug

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A L<Bot::Cobalt> plugin.

Play the game of F-Marry-Kill with the bot.  Essentially you just give it
three names in a comma separated list, and it randomizes them.  A very stupid,
trivial plugin, that people seem to enjoy nonetheless.

   #mychannel> !fmk Scott, Ann, Barry
   < mybot> Hug: [Ann] - Marry: [Barry] - Kill: [Scott]
